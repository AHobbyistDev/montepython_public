Problems to be addressed
========================


- beam not defined 613 likelihood_class.py
- 382 of analyze: rewrite !
- part to read chains from cosmomc does not work
- tricky trick to change: **solved with imaginary number**
- had a :code:`0 == 1` inside a code ? Now disappeared ? Which version was
  that ? For the :code:`.v_info` file, and the tex output.
- We wanted to do sthg about parameter names too exotic, with ", ^, etc,
  replaced by a _ What was it already ?
- Check behaviour of current :code:`-all` option flag. Is this working ? line
  787, from old :code:`svn_montepython`
- formula scalable for a decent fontsize and ticksize
- :code:`self.new_scales` to remove from :code:`analyze.py`
- :code:`mcmc.py`: the super trick will fail, we should completely fix it.
