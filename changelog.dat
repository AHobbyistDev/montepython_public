v1.1.0: - Added the following likelihoods: spt_2500 (full data release), bao,
	timedelay, and updated the value for hst (1103.2976)
	- Removed the call to function cosmo_update_arguments() in the
	initialization of the data module. This was not needed, and
	complicated the function. Now cosmo_update_arguments does not need the
	try, except pattern.
	- Changed the way to handle boundary for proposal density. The "-1"
	can still be used, when no boundary is meant. "-1." will be
	interpretated as a boundary of -1 not to cross (useful for w). The
	user can also use "None".
	- Added a lockfile system, that should prevent a file from being
	written simultaneously by two programs, when launching several
	different runs at the same time.
	- New extensions available for print-outs with the analyze module. Use
	the command line option "-ext png", or eps, or pdf (from fastest, to
	slowest). 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.1: - Removed the first and unwanted line of code/mcmc.py, that was
pointlessly trying to import again Class. This conflicted in case of a
non-installation of the Class wrapper.
	- Modified '0.9' in '1.0' in a print statement in MontePython.py
v1.0.0: Initial release
