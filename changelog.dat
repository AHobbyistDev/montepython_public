v1.1.1: - Removed the comparison between input param and log.param:
	always choose the latest.
	- Transfered the log_flag from being an indendent quantity
	being exchanged between data and likelihoods to a proper
	attribute of the data class. Since no comparison is done
	any-more, there was no reason to keep it this way anymore.
	- Renamed both io.py and parser.py into io_mp.py and
	parser_mp.py (mp for Monte Python). It was conflicting with
	some installed packages of python, both being some very often
	used names.
	- Removed the common.py file, merging its content (lockfile
	system) with io_mp.py
v1.1.0: - Added the following likelihoods: SPT full data (called spt_2500 in
	the likelihood directory), compilation of BAO scale data (called bao),
	compilation of quasar time-delay data (called timedelay), timedelay, and
	updated the value for hst (1103.2976)
	- To speed up the production of plots, you can play with a new
	extension defining the print-out format: use the command-line option
	"-ext png", or eps, or pdf (from the fastest to the slowest format)
	- Added a lockfile system, that should prevent a file from being
	written simultaneously by two programs, when launching several
	different runs at the same time.
	- Changed a detail in the input file syntax, concerning parameter
	prior edges. To leave the prior edge undefined, you can still use "-1"
	as before, or "None". But if your prior edge is really minus one (for
	instance for w), you can write "-1."
	- Function cosmo_update_arguments() modified for better readability
	and simpler use (this function allows to rename or remap input
	parameters at each step before passing them to CLASS). The syntax
	pattern "try, except" is not needed anymore
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.0.1: - Removed the first and unwanted line of code/mcmc.py, that was
	pointlessly trying to import again Class. This conflicted in case of a
	non-installation of the Class wrapper.
	- Modified '0.9' in '1.0' in a print statement in MontePython.py
v1.0.0: Initial release
